# Micor mechanics approach to fluid dynamics. Simple to Complex

When I was under grad student, I studied fluid dynamics and thermo dynamics. There were PDE. How does it analysed? Harmonic analysis? So what? I know about FEM but I thought it is just calculation. What can be known by just calculation? Then, I stopped to study fluid dynamics.

Now, I know the power of numerical calculation and hypotheis driven. I studied enough amount of control engineering and material mechanics. Then, I think it is good timing to study and reserch fluid dynamics.

In this report and repository, some kind of study and reserach will be taken. The methodolody is assumed to be hypothesis driven physical modelling and micro-mechanics apparoch and visualizing with numerical simulation using Python and OpenGL/GLUT.

It could be said that C++ is faster than Python. However, considering educational effect and openness to every one, Python would be utilized.
