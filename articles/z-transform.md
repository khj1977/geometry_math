# Study and examination of z-transform

## 3D gnuplot for z-transform

For 1 > 1.0, it seems it is close to descreate laplace transform esp. with n > 0. Thus I think it is appropriate to use z-trans to digital control.


$X(n) = \sin t + \sin 100t$

Why r > 1.0 for many r? It seems it is multiple laplace transform. It means Z(x(n)) := set of laplace transform for digital. If it were analysis, is s and $1/(s + 2)$ for instance. It could be supposed that since it is numeric, set of digital laplace transform is utilized.
