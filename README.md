# geometry_math

In this repository, several numerical simulation for geometry and manifold will be impled. matplot lib will be used for visualization. Why not C++ and OpenGL? It is because it is not required to massive number of calculation and REPL cycle would be important compared with particle simulation.

Differential and integral? For me, it have relation ship to geometry especially, it is visualized. Moreover, for advanced topic, ODE could be expressed by matrix and vector. They may have geometrically meaning.

Line integral is interesting math expression for me. As symbol, it is easy to understand raw meaning, it is difficult to understand numerically and programmary.

For me, conbination of geometry and manifold seems close to albegra-geometry in old high school text.

Applications areas are assumed to be analysis of ODE esp, smart material systems, robotics, automatic controlled vehicle and so on.
