# geometry, manifold, differential and integral.

In this repository, several numerical simulation for geometry and manifold will be impled. matplot lib will be used for visualization. Why not C++ and OpenGL? It is because it is not required to massive number of calculation and REPL cycle would be important compared with particle simulation.

Differential and integral? For me, it have relation ship to geometry especially, it is visualized. Moreover, for advanced topic, ODE could be expressed by matrix and vector. They may have geometrically meaning.

Line integral is interesting math expression for me. As symbol, it is easy to understand raw meaning, it is difficult to understand numerically and programmary.

For me, conbination of geometry and manifold seems close to albegra-geometry in old high school text.

Applications areas are assumed to be analysis of ODE esp, smart material systems, robotics, automatic controlled vehicle, fluid dynamics, electro-magnetic dynamics and so on.

# note on numerical differentiation and education esp. Japanese high school

loop with decreasement of xdot for numerical diff has been impled. In high school analytical diff, it would be ordinary to express diff with line to understand what is differentiation. This is numerical version of that. If a user is not familiar with differentiation, it would be good idea to play with numerical differentiation.

The author thinks that Japanese high school student think too much about technique for exam for entrace of Univs. Memorize formula, memorize past test. But don't think meaning. Is it because of students? The author thinks no. I think it is mistake of Ministry of Education.

Several years before, suddenly, I read past exam of Univ Tokyo. It seems it is not so difficult. If author is serious about that book, it would be possible to obtain 60% by study from 2nd year of high school. Actually, when I was high school student, I didn't but past exam book of red-book. It is recommended to go to middle range national university and then, go to Titech or Tsukuba by master. The author is First Class (over 70% is A grade) B.Eng and skipped British M.Phil. I think have right to say about education.

All in all, the author recommend to study real math and physics as I shown in this rep. PC would be expensive for high school student. Do part time job, buy functional calculator and graph-paper. And then, place with algebra, geometry, differeitiation and integration. Physics and ordinary differential equation is plus.
